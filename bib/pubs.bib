abstract = {Detection of fraud, waste, and abuse (FWA) is an important yet challenging problem. In this article, we describe a system to detect suspicious activities in large healthcare datasets. Each healthcare dataset is viewed as a heterogeneous network consisting of millions of patients, hundreds of thousands of doctors, tens of thousands of pharmacies, and other entities. Graph analysis techniques are developed to find suspicious individuals, suspicious relationships between individuals, unusual changes over time, unusual geospatial dispersion, and anomalous network structure. The visualization interface, known as the Network Explorer, provides a good overview of data and enables users to filter, select, and zoom into network details on demand. The system has been deployed on multiple sites and datasets, both government and commercial, and identified many overpayments with a potential value of several million dollars per month.},

abstract = {It is common to classify data in hierarchies, they provide a comprehensible way of understanding big amounts of data. From budgets to organizational charts or even the stock market, trees are everywhere and people find them easy to use. However when analysts need to compare two versions of the same tree structure, or two related taxonomies, the task is not so easy. Much work has been done on this topic, but almost all of it has been restricted to either compare the trees by topology, or by the node attribute values. With this project we are proposing TreeVersity, a framework for comparing tree structures, both by structural changes and by differences in the node attributes. This paper is based on our previous work on comparing traffic agencies using LifeFlow [1, 2] and on a first prototype of TreeVersity.},

abstract = {Transportation datasets of all kinds are hierarchical in nature, and therefore easily represented in tree structures. Visually comparing the changes in these hierarchical datasets over time can be extremely difficult, even when the trees are relatively small. TreeVersity is a novel interactive visualization that allows users to detect and analyze changes in the structure and value of various components of the tree. TreeVersity uses dual comparison techniques (side-by-side and explicit differences) coupled with a tabular representation to help users understand and explore changes to the tree over time. It uses carefully selected color palettes to show positive/negative, absolute and relative value changes; and glyphs that preattentively show these changes. This paper illustrates the value of this visualization technique through various short case studies using Federal transportation budget data, airline maintenance budget data and transportation publication data. Also it hypothesizes about TreeVersity's relevance for future congestion trend analysis. Video demonstrations of this research can be viewed at http://tinyurl.com/treeversity Figure 1: TreeVersity comparison interface. On the top are the two original trees being compared (budgets for 2011 and 2012). At the bottom the DiffTree shows the amount of change for each node.

We describe a visual analytics tool for temporal data exploration, called LifeFlow, used for the analysis of incident response data. LifeFlow provides user-controlled overviews of event sequences (e.g. notification, arrival, clearance etc). It allows analysts to interactively explore temporal patterns, find anomalies in sequences and compare management practices. This type of analysis can potentially lead to process improvements and save human lives. We used NCHRP traffic incident data with more than 200,000 incidents are reported by eight different agencies in a period of about 28 months. Our experience suggest that even non expert analysts can spot many anomalies in the data using the LifeFlow overviews, and are able to rapidly ask many questions and find differences between agencies.},

abstract = {Analyzing important changes to massive transportation datasets like national bottleneck statistics, passenger data for domestic flights, airline maintenance budgets, or even publication data from the Transportation Research Record can be extremely complex. These types of datasets are often grouped by attributes in a tree structure hierarchy. The parent–child relationships of these hierarchical datasets allow for unique analytical opportunities, including the ability to track changes in the dataset at different levels of granularity, over time or between versions. For example, analysts can use hierarchies to uncover changes in the patterns of passengers flying in the United States over the last ten years, breaking down the data by states, cities, airports, and number of passengers. Exploring changes in travel patterns over time can help carriers make better decisions regarding their operations and long-range planning. This paper describes TreeVersity2, a web-based data comparison tool that provides users with information visualization techniques to find what has changed in a dataset over time. TreeVersity2 enables users to explore data that can be inherently hierarchical or not (by categorizing them by their attributes). An interactive textual reporting tool complements the visual exploration when the amount of data is very large. The results of two case studies conducted with transportation domain experts along with the results of an exit questionnaire are also described. TreeVersity2 preloaded with several demo datasets can be found at (http://treeversity.cattlab.umd.edu) along with several example videos.},

@phdthesis{GuerraGomez2013c,
abstract = {Hierarchies are a useful way of representing data. The parent-child relationships they define facilitate the analysis of a dataset by breaking it down into its component parts. Representing data as hierarchies can also be used to track changes to a dataset over time or between versions. For example, analysts can use hierarchies to uncover changes in the US Federal Budget in the last twenty years, by grouping accounts by Agencies and Bureaus. Similarly, a company manager can analyze changes to their product sales due to the holiday season by breaking them up by markets and product categories. Exploring differences in such trees could help them understand changes in the data. However, comparing hierarchies is a difficult task, even when comparing two trees with a small number of nodes. To address this, information visualization techniques were used to support data comparison tasks using hierarchies. After evaluating my techniques with domain experts on real world problems, I identified and addressed two main research topics: This dissertation first tackled the problem of comparing two versions of a tree by using two types of change, while most of the significant work on this topic has focused only on changes in node values or changes in topology. TreeVersity (❤tt♣✿✴✴❤❝✐❧✳ ❝s✳✉♠❞✳❡❞✉✴tr❡❡✈❡rs✐t2) is a comparison tool that allows users to explore changes between two versions of a tree by tracking node value differences, and newly created or removed nodes. Domain experts using TreeVersity were excited to discover differencesin the trees, but expressed a desire to explore the evolution of a dataset over time. To that end, they suggested applying TreeVersity comparison capabilities to datasets that were non inherently hierarchical. Following users' feedback, the problem of exploring changes over time in datasets that can be categorized as trees was addressed next. TreeVersity2 (❤tt♣✿✴✴tr❡❡✈❡rs✐t2✳ ❝❛tt❧❛❜✳✉♠❞✳❡❞✉ is a web-based data comparison tool that allows users to explore a tree that changes over time and of datasets that are not inherently hierarchical, by cate- gorizing them by their attributes. TreeVersity2 also helps users navigate the sometimes large amounts of differences between versions of a tree using an interactive textual re- porting tool. My research has resulted in three main contributions: First, the introduction of the Bullet, a visualization glyph to represent four characteristics of change (as described in Section 1.2) in tree nodes, and the implementation of the Bullet in TreeVersity. Second, the creation of the StemView, a tree visualization technique that represents five charac- teristics of change in all the nodes of a tree (not just the leaves), and the implementation of the StemView in TreeVersity2. Furthermore, my research resulted in the development of the reporting tool, another feature of TreeVersity2, which helps users navigate out- standing changes in the tree with textual representations and coordinated interactions. Third, the development of 13 case studies with domain experts on real world comparison problems. The case studies have validated the utility and flexibility of my approaches. Finally, my research opens possibilities for future research on comparing hierarchical structures.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).Online photo collections are often presented along with numeric data, such as views, likes, or comments. Treemaps are ideal for visualizing such collections, as they present numeric values using rectangular blocks, within which photos can be presented. Despite abundant research showing that photo treemaps and similar space-filling approaches are useful and appealing for users, understanding of the ideal parameters for constructing these representations remains limited. To address this, we contribute a series of experiments targeted at identifying design parameters for building photo treemaps. Our first study explores the number of photos presented at each level in the treemap, finding that using fewer photos makes visualizations more searchable and preferable to users. A second study examines the tradeoff between sizing photos according to the numeric values and presenting them in a more familiar layout with fixed aspect ratios. These results inform a third study, in which a prototype was used to probe the preferences of active Flickr users for using treemaps for navigating photo collections.},

TreeVersity uses dual comparison techniques (side by side and explicit differences) coupled with a tabular representation to help users understand and explore changes to the tree over time. TreeVersity uses carefully selected color palettes to show positive or negative absolute and relative value changes and glyphs that show these changes preattentively. A study illustrated the value of this visualization technique through various short case studies based on federal transportation budget data, airline maintenance budget data, and transportation publication data. Hypotheses for TreeVersity's future relevance for congestion trend analysis are provided.},

abstract = {To analyze data such as the US Federal Budget or characteristics of the student population of a University it is common to look for changes over time. This task can be made easier and more fruitful if the analysis is performed by grouping by attributes, such as by Agencies, Bureaus and Accounts for the Budget, or Ethnicity, Gender and Major in a University. We present TreeVersity2, a web based interactive data visualization tool that allows users to analyze change in datasets by creating dynamic hierarchies based on the data attributes. TreeVersity2 introduces a novel space filling visualization (StemView) to represent change in trees at multiple levels--not just at the leaf level. With this visualization users can explore absolute and relative changes, created and removed nodes, and each node's actual values, while maintaining the context of the tree. In addition, TreeVersity2 provides overviews of change over the entire time period, and a reporting tool that lists outliers in textual form, which helps users identify the major changes in the data without having to manually setup filters. We validated TreeVersity2 with 12 case studies with organizations as diverse as the National Cancer Institute, Federal Drug Administration, Department of Transportation, Office of the Bursar of the University of Maryland, or eBay. Our case studies demonstrated that TreeVersity2 is flexible enough to be used in different domains and provide useful insights for the data owners. A TreeVersity2 demo can be found at https://treeversity.cattlab.umd.edu.},

abstract = {As the world becomes more complex and plagued by wicked problems, there is an increased need for more multifaceted visual frameworks to untangle and clarify global issues. Budgets, census outcomes, stock market results, and other statistical data are best understood and explored through comparison, however to date there has been no effective visual solution framework for assessing a variety of hierarchal data sets. TreeVersity, a new interactive framework, is changing this. TreeVersity facilitates visual comparisons for hierarchical data, revealing trends, significant changes and other data revelations through multiple tree visualizations. The framework enables comparison within small, 10-node data sets to those with as many as 1,000,000 data points or more; it can reveal both overall structural changes such as the addition and removal of nodes and the differences in the node attributes including absolute and relative changes. TreeVersity is a user-centric program that delivers control of information to its users, allowing them to select, prioritize, recast and narrate the story they want data sets to tell. It offers customization of color ranges as well as the expansion or deletion of visual nodes based upon a user's desired data-significance range. Users can quickly discover relevant information through framework interaction that includes real- time highlighting of hyperlinked relevant nodes and branches. TreeVersity offers both macro and micro views of comparison data through the dynamic progressive exposure of information, as dictated by the user. The project has progressed significantly, and TreeVersity collaborators will continue to develop the framework. In this paper, we will present TreeVersity through data visualizations as well as outline the visual system's in-progress expansion possibilities.},
